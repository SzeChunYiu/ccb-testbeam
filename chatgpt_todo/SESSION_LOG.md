# Session Log

## 2026-07-21T18:00Z — AUD-CI-001

- Initial main: `3dbfcbaf1babe69b98c94ada34d48b5b7f84024e`
- Reviewed PR #868 metadata and Actions run `29855061309`.
- Downloaded artifact `8504991924` and inspected `ruff.log` and `pytest.log`.
- Measured CI results: pytest `147 passed, 1 skipped in 41.64s`; ruff exactly three E501 violations.
- Scientific interpretation: synthetic Python tests pass, but no evidence yet establishes Geant4 compilation, real ROOT reproducibility, forced-thread provenance, seed independence, or the optical-yield claim.
- Work: created the canonical `chatgpt_todo/` coordination system directly on `main`; did not merge PR #868.
- Validation: repository and CI facts were confirmed through GitHub metadata and the retained workflow artifact. No local runtime checks were available.
- Blockers: BLK-CI-001, BLK-G4-001, BLK-MERGE-001.
- Next: apply only the three demonstrated line-wrap fixes on PR #868 and rerun CI; then execute supported Geant4/ROOT validation.

## Current steering notes

- Queue health: `tn-ticket list --project testbeam` reports `open=26 claimed=4 done=18 failed=7`;
  no tickets were appended in this cycle because the ready queue is above the 18-ticket floor.
  The legacy positional command `tn-ticket list testbeam` still reports the default queue
  (`open=3 claimed=0 done=0 failed=6`), so use `--project testbeam` for steering.
- Newest reports sharpen the next claims: S00b turns selector/baseline semantics into a small but
  real systematic; S02b shows a strong traditional timewalk closure can beat the S02 ridge
  baseline on run 65; S03a lowers sigma68 further but needs leave-one-run-out stability; S07b
  proves D_t labels are self-referential; S07c shows shape RF can beat q_template-only on weak
  clean-timing labels, but the historical App.A table must be recovered or retired; P10a says
  conditional templates need explicit timewalk terms; P04 is a strong duplicate-readout closure,
  not an energy calibration.
- Active ready follow-ups already cover the requested atomic pulse axes: P01c/P02b/P03a for
  shape and timing, P04b/P04c/P07b/P10b/P10c for amplitude, charge, saturation, and template
  phase, S10c/S11a for pile-up, S00c/S16c/S16d for selector, baseline, and dropout, and
  S07d/S07e/S18b for control labels and external timing checks.
- Near-term physics risk: ML wins only when the traditional comparator is genuinely weaker on
  the same held-out data. Keep every new claim paired, run-held-out, leakage-audited, and
  bootstrap-CI based before feeding PID or energy studies.
